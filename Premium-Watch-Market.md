Leading watch brands are also capitalizing on digital transformation by incorporating smart features into their traditional timepieces, which is attracting tech-savvy consumers while maintaining the brand's premium image. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China and India, is anticipated to lead in terms of market expansion due to the growing affluence of middle and upper-class consumers.
